# Nativefier is bonkers - DEV

I made an electron app in 4 lines...  

    
    
    nativefier "http://musicforprogramming.net/" -n "musicforprogramming"
    cd musicforprogramming-linux-x64/
    sudo chmod +x musicforprogramming
    ./musicforprogramming
    

I like music, but don't like music in browser tabs. Basically because i have it open all the time, I want to find and control it easily, and I don't want it cluttering up an area that might be soley focused on work. 

I discovered some neat apps for google play, and wanted to see if there was one for my other go to, [musicforprogramming][1]. There wasn't, so I just casually googled how to convert a page into an electron app and OMFG!

###  Make any web page a desktop application 

![Build Status][2] ![npm version][3]

![Dock][4]

You want to make a native wrapper for WhatsApp Web (or any web page).
    
    
    nativefier web.whatsapp.com

![Walkthrough animation][5]

You're done.

##  Introduction

Nativefier is a command-line tool to easily create a desktop application for any web site with succinct and minimal configuration. Apps are wrapped by [Electron][6] in an OS executable (`.app`, `.exe`, etc.) for use on Windows, macOS and Linux.

I did this because I was tired of having to `âŒ˜-tab` or `alt-tab` to my browser and then search through the numerous open tabs when I was using [Facebook Messenger][7] or [Whatsapp Web][8] ([relevant Hacker News thread][9]).

[Changelog][10]. [Developer docs][11].

Features:

* Automatically retrieves the correct icon and app name.
* JavaScript and CSS injection.
* Many more, see the [API docs][12] or `nativefier --help`

##  Installation

* macOS 10.9+ / Windows / Linux
* [Node.js][13] `>= 10`
* Optional dependencies 

[This post][14] and [this one][15] helped iron out some kinks and now I can launch programming music right from my VS code terminal!
