# Why Money Does Buy Happiness

## Introduction

You've probably heard people say "money doesn't buy happiness", but in my opinion it does.

## How?

Lets think about what money buys. Money buys your food, home, electricity, and peace of mind. Money buys your entertainment, your lesiure, and your fun. Money buys your education and your tools. Money buys almost everything you could think of. Now think about this: would you be happy without all those things? Money is what gives you the ability to have all those things. Without money, you would have no peace of mind and would have no home and no food. You would not be happy at all.
