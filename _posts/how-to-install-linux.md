-step 1: 
download an iso of the distro. some user friendly distros i recommend for beginners are ubuntu, and linux lite.
once you get the iso file, it should be 1.0GB+ 

-step 2:
Burn the iso to a disk or usb drive. i use a tool called etcher. download it at https://etcher.io
once the iso is burned, put usb or disk in device and move on to your device instructions
